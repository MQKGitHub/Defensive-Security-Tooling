### 🧠 Overview

### 🔧 CyberChef: The Basics  
- Learned how to use CyberChef, a web-based tool for encoding, decoding, and transforming data through step-by-step “recipes”.  
- Practised using operations like Base64, URL encoding, ROT13, and data extraction to solve real-world-style challenges in a fun, hands-on way.

### 🕵️ CAPA: The Basics  
- Explored CAPA, a static malware analysis tool, and learned how it detects behaviors like process creation and HTTP communication using predefined rules and frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK and MBC.  
- Gained hands-on experience analyzing binary files, interpreting verbose outputs, and using CAPA Web Explorer for clearer visualization of results.

### 🧪 REMnux: Getting Started  
- Explored the REMnux VM, a Linux distro for malware analysis, and learned tools like `oledump.py` for macro extraction, `INetSim` for fake network simulation, and `Volatility 3` for memory forensics.  
- Gained hands-on experience de-obfuscating PowerShell scripts, analyzing malicious Office files, and using `strings` for quick binary triage in a safe lab environment.
